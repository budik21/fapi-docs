There is no real graphQL object called `Statistics`.

The Football API allows you to query data at multiple levels of detail. We distinguish between granular data (related to a specific a match) and aggregated statistics (season totals, player careers). Furthermore, majority of metrics are segmented to provide insights at both the team level and individual player level.

## Granular statistics
The most granular statistics are provided on match level.


## Aggregated statistics
### Team statistics
#### Per Season

### Player statistics
#### Per Career
#### Per Season/Season Stage
